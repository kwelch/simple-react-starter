# Simple React Starter

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kwelch/simple-react-start.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kwelch/simple-react-start)

I built this mostly has a test to myself of being able to setup webpack, babel, dev-server, and react from scratch. 

It ended up being so minimal I felt it would be a good place to start in the event that I need to start another web app. 

If it helps you great, but it has already server my purposes.
