# Simple React Starter

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kwelch/simple-react-starter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kwelch/simple-react-starter)

I built this mostly as a test to myself of being able to setup webpack, babel, dev-server, and react from scratch.

It ended up being so minimal I felt it would be a good place to start in the event that I need to start another web app.

If it helps you great, but it has already served my purposes.

I welcome any feedback or pull request, please keep minimalism/non-opinoinated in mind.
